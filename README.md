# Ascii Art

This basic project was done with regards to a course on Coursera, by University of Michigan.

This is a basic PHP project to display an ASCII art of the first letter of my name.
Addition to that, the use of hash method for SHA256 was integrated.

You must run these files in your PHP server. Make a folder under your htdocs folder and then place your files in that folder. The htdocs folder is in different locations depending on your web server:

Windows XAMPP: c:\xampp\htdocs
